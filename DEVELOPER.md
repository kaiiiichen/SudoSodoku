## 🛠️ For Contributors

If you're interested in contributing code, here are our development guidelines:

### Code Organization

We follow these principles:
- **MVVM Pattern**: Maintain clear separation between Models, Views, and ViewModels
- **File Structure**: Place files in appropriate directories (Models, Views, Managers, etc.)
- **Dependency Injection**: Use shared instances appropriately
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure updates don't break existing functionality

### Testing

We test thoroughly:
- Unit tests for core logic
- UI tests for new features
- Performance testing
- User acceptance testing

### Documentation

We maintain documentation:
- Update README for user-facing changes
- Add clear code comments (in English)
- Update CHANGELOG for releases
- Create guides for complex features

### Git Workflow

Our contribution process:
- Create feature branches (`feature/your-feature`)
